1 - About
---------
Dodgy Spike is an endless runner style game created for the Mobile Applicatations module in GMIT (Semester 6) on April 15th 2015.
It was also entered into the Irish Games Fleadh (Festival) 2015 in Athlone, Thurles.
Created by Ronan Connolly - RonconApps.


The game is set in a red cave world, you are a star and must dodge two different styles of spikes that generate on both sides of the cave walls.
As the game progresses you get faster and so do the spikes coming towards you.
The game is played in portrait mode.

It is available on on the Windows Phone and Android store.  
*Links below in section: 4 - Installation Steps (store)*

The Android version contains some updates and tweaks, such as smoother game play and better general game flow, the android version also uses the Google Play Games Services which means you can log in, see your friends scores (or global scores), challenges and total spikes dodged.
This is implemented through the google play dashboard and also the Unity plugin for google play services found here:

2 - Tools & Evironment used
---------------------------
This game was created using Unity 4 (version 4.6.1f1) on OSX Yosemite (version 10.10.2
The unity project opens perfectly fine on a Windows machine.

In order to build the Windows version I opened the project up on a Windows 8.1 machine and compiled it there.
The editor used was Unitys built in MonoDevelop-Unity (version 4.0.1)


3 - Installation Steps (unity)
-----------------------------
Open the project file on any OS.
In the project window open the Scenes folder and open the Menu Scene.
Once open you will see the menu scene open, in the middle of the Unity editor at the top you will see a play, pause and next button, press the play button.
The game will start to run in the Game window, here you can play the game.
If you would like to play the game in full screen mode, be sure to select the "Maximize on Play" button in the Game window before pressing the Play button.

If you would like to build this game and run on your local device then from the menu bar select File -> Build Settings -> <Select Platform> -> Switch Platform -> Build And Run
When you switch the platform the keystore and password that you use for the store gets removed (this is okay as this key should be kept somewhere safe).

The game at the moment is optomized for Android so there may be a bug when running on Windows as the Google Play Services is created for Android.
If you would like to test I would recommend using the Unity Game Window, Building for Web or else downloading from the store.

7 - Summary
-----------
Overall the project was a success, in less then two months we learned how to use Unity, apply game dynamics and fundementals, created a working game implementing many features, uploaded it successfully to the Windows Phone and Android stores and entered into the Irish Games Fleadh.  
Much was learned during this process.  
The Unity website has some amazing tutorials and documentation.  
Some of the other places help and information was found was: Stack Overflow, YouTube tutorials and the general help and group work with other people also creating Unity games.  

8 - Extras
----------
The design document that was used for the Irish Games Fleadh is also in this repository.  
The poster for the game is also located here.  
The _builds folder is not as the game builds are too large for github, but these are unneeded as you would build it yourself if you were to edit this project.
