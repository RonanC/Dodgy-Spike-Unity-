1 - About
---------
Dodgy Spike is an endless runner style game created for the Mobile Applicatations module in GMIT (Semester 6) on April 15th 2015.
It was also entered into the Irish Games Fleadh (Festival) 2015 in Athlone, Thurles.

The game is set in a red cave world, you are a star and must dodge two different styles of spikes that generate on both sides of the cave walls.
As the game progresses you get faster and so do the spikes coming towards you.
The game is played in portrait mode.

It is available on on the Windows Phone and Android store.
Windows Store:
https://www.windowsphone.com/en-ie/store/app/dodgy-spike/64b32eaf-42c3-48ac-ae57-fd06483eb261
Android:

The Android version contains some updates and tweaks, such as smoother game play and better general game flow, the android version also uses the Google Play Games Services which means you can log in, see your friends scores (or global scores), challenges and total spikes dodged.
This is implemented through the google play dashboard and also the Unity plugin for google play services found here:

2 - Tools & Evironment used
---------------------------
This game was created using Unity 4 (version 4.6.1f1) on OSX Yosemite (version 10.10.2
The unity project opens perfectly fine on a Windows machine.

In order to build the Windows version I opened the project up on a Windows 8.1 machine and compiled it there.
The editor used was Unitys built in MonoDevelop-Unity (version 4.0.1)


3 - Installation Steps (unity)
-----------------------------
Open the project file on any OS.
In the project window open the Scenes folder and open the Menu Scene.
Once open you will see the menu scene open, in the middle of the Unity editor at the top you will see a play, pause and next button, press the play button.
The game will start to run in the Game window, here you can play the game.
If you would like to play the game in full screen mode, be sure to select the "Maximize on Play" button in the Game window before pressing the Play button.

If you would like to build this game and run on your local device then from the menu bar select File -> Build Settings -> <Select Platform> -> Switch Platform -> Build And Run
When you switch the platform the key that you use for the store gets removed (this is okay as this key should be kept somewhere safe).
